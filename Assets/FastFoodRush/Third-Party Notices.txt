Thank you for downloading 
THE BOLD FONT.

It is a 100% free font so you can use it as much as you like for whatever you like.
Of course, every donation for my effort would be highly appreciated. You can find a donate button on the DaFont page where you downloaded the font.

Did you know that there is also a PRO version available? It comes with lowercase characters and has way more glyphs than the free version. You can get it at:

WWW.THE-BOLD-FONT.COM 

Thank you so much and have fun designing with THE BOLD FONT!

Yours sincerely,
Sven Pels
THE BOLD FONT.
